## üìä Tech Stack

- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free forever)

- **RSVP**: Google Forms (free, no limits)
- **Offline**: Service Worker
- **Animations**: CSS + Intersection Observer
- **Sharing**: Web Share API

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is this really free?**
A: Yes! GitHub Pages is free for public repos. Your only cost might be a custom domain (optional).

**Q: Can guests RSVP on their phones?**
A: Yes! The Google Form embed is fully responsive.

**Q: What if GitHub Pages goes down?**
A: The site works offline once visited. GitHub Pages has 99.9% uptime.

**Q: Can I add more pages?**
A: Yes! Create new HTML files and link them in the navigation.

**Q: How do I see RSVP responses?**
A: Check your Google Form responses or link it to a Google Sheet.

## üîí Security for Google Forms

**IMPORTANT**: Protect your RSVP form from spam and uninvited responses:

1. **Limit Responses**: Settings ‚Üí Responses ‚Üí "Limit to 1 response"
2. **Add Passcode**: Include a passcode field that only invited guests know
3. **Email Collection**: Require email addresses to track responses
4. **Response Receipts**: Send confirmation emails to respondents
5. **Review Regularly**: Check for suspicious submissions

Example passcode question: "What's the secret word? (Hint: it rhymes with 'love')"

## üöÄ Local Development

For the best experience, use Bun for local development:

```bash
# Install Bun (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Start dev server (auto-converts YAML to JSON)
bun run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Build for Production

Before deploying to GitHub Pages, convert your YAML config to JSON:

```bash
# Build config.json from config.yaml
bun run build

# Commit both files
git add config.yaml config.json
git commit -m "Update config"
git push
```

**Why the build step?** GitHub Pages is static hosting, so we can't parse YAML client-side reliably. The build step keeps your config human-friendly (YAML) while serving fast, reliable JSON to browsers.

## üí° Tips

1. **Test on your phone** before sharing with guests
2. **Keep images small** - use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) to compress
3. **Set up early** - gives you time to make tweaks
4. **Share the link** 2-3 months before the wedding
5. **Backup your config** - save a copy of config.yaml
